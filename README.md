# GENERALIZED-ADDITIVE-NEURAL-NETWORKS

Generalized Additive Neural Networks (GANNs) integrate the power of neural networks
and the interpretability of Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). This thesis try to offer
a comprehensive theoretical context, starting with the origins of linear models, follow-
ing with generalized models and ending with the explanation GANNs. We review the
mathematical formulation, advantages, and disadvantages of GANNs compared to tra-
ditional models and some nonparametric methods. In addition, we will present a real
application that demonstrate how GANNs have a good predictive accuracy and a great
model interpretability. This thesis shows how flexible GANNs are,and how they could
support machine learning and statistical modeling to improve.
